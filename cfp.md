# Call for Papers

The integration of QC into HPC centers has become a topic of increasing interest and urgency. This workshop will focus on the actions needed to achieve this integration when addressing various layers.

**Topics of Interest**:

*	Programming models for HPC-Quantum integration
*	Environmental and infrastructure considerations
*	Integrated scheduling environments
*	Operating system extensions for seamless integration
*	Quantum software stacks and toolkits
*	Benchmarking and performance evaluation of HPC-Quantum systems
*	Scalability challenges in HPC-Quantum systems
*	Quantum-accelerated HPC system software

Papers that are accepted will be included in the **Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library**. All submitted papers should represent original work that has not been previously published or is currently under consideration for any other conference or journal. Papers uploaded to the arXiv are eligible, as arXiv doos not provide peer reviewe and so does not count as a prior pubblication. Reviewing process will conducted in a single-blind manner.

The proceedings for HPQCI will be published by ACM in the HPDC proceedings companion book. Authors are required to be ready to sign a copyright transfer statement. Additionally, for each accepted paper or demo, at least one author must register for the workshop by the early registration date (TBD), actively participate, and present the work.

**Important Dates**
