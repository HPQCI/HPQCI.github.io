The integration of QC into HPC centers has become a topic of increasing interest and urgency. This workshop will focus on the actions needed to achieve this integration when addressing various layers.

**Topics of Interest**:

*	Programming models for HPC-Quantum integration
*	Environmental and infrastructure considerations
*	Integrated scheduling environments
*	Operating system extensions for seamless integration
*	Quantum software stacks and toolkits
*	Benchmarking and performance evaluation of HPC-Quantum systems
*	Scalability challenges in HPC-Quantum systems
*	Quantum-accelerated HPC system software

Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and published by ACM in the workshop proceedings. All submitted papers should represent original work that has not been previously published or is currently under consideration for any other conference or journal. Papers uploaded to the arXiv are eligible, as arXiv does not provide peer review and does not count as a prior publication. The reviewing process will conducted in a single-blind manner.
