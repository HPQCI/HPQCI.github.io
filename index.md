# First International Workshop on High Performance and Quantum Computing Integration (2024)

_Held in conjunction with the [33rd International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing](https://www.hpdc.org/2024/)_

High-performance computing (HPC) has witnessed significant milestones in its evolution, each wave of innovation breaking performance barriers and leading to groundbreaking scientific discoveries. As Quantum Computing (QC) matures, the question is no longer just about its theoretical capabilities, but also its applicability in real-world computing environments. Consequently, the HPC community is now turning its attention to the potential of QC as the next frontier in advancing the field.
However, for QC to realize its potential, it must be seamlessly integrated into the realm of high-performance computing. The integration of QC into HPC centers has become a topic of increasing interest and urgency. This workshop will focus on the actions needed to achieve this integration when addressing various layers, including programming models, environmental and infrastructure requirements, integrated scheduling environments, and operating system extensions. The degree of such integration into the various layers, whether it is very loose, where jobs are dispatched to remote schedulers in the cloud, or very, with direct physical connection to the control unit, will define the effort required by the interested actors.

## Call for Papers

The integration of QC into HPC centers has become a topic of increasing interest and urgency. This workshop will focus on the actions needed to achieve this integration when addressing various layers.

**Topics of Interests**:

*	Programming models for HPC-Quantum integration
*	Environmental and infrastructure considerations
*	Integrated scheduling environments
*	Operating system extensions for seamless integration
*	Case studies and real-world applications
*	Quantum software stacks and toolkits
*	Benchmarking and performance evaluation of HPC-Quantum systems
*	Scalability challenges in HPC-Quantum systems
*	Quantum-accelerated HPC

Papers that are accepted will be included in the **Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library**. All submitted papers should represent original work that has not been previously published or is currently under consideration for any other conference or journal. papers uploaded to the arXiv are eligible, as arXiv doos not provide peer reviewe and so does not count as a prior pubblication. Reviewing process will conducted in a single-blind manner.

The proceedings for HPQCI will be published by ACM in the HPDC proceedings companion boook. Authors are required to be ready to sign a copyright transfer statement. Additionally, for each accepted paper or demo, at least one author must register for the workshop by the early registration date (TBD), actively participate, and present the work.

**Important Dates**
*	Submission deadline: 22nd March
*	Notification: 11th April
*	Camera ready version: 18th April

### Authors Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit papers of the following types and lengths, in the ACM sigconf format style:

*	Regular papers (maximum 10 pages, references excluded), 10 minutes talks including questions
*	Short papers (maximum 4 pages, excluded references), 5 minutes talks including questions

Submissions will be received via HotCRP:
